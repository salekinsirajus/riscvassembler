I will be writing stuff here I find interesting while doing
this project. Later on I might use this to write a couple of
blog posts etc.

## Grammar
I had a difficult time finding a well-defined assembly grammar for
RISC-V. It seems as though gas, nasm, and masm (and others) contributed
to a mashed-potatoe of assembly grammar and they borrow syntax
from one another. So it's hard to write an assembler when you don't have
a BNF of the grammar for the language.

## JUMP Statements
I didn't know they were psuedo instructions.
